    "The F-value obtained from the F-test is approximately 0.703, and the corresponding p-value is approximately 0.430. The p-value represents the probability of observing an F-statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the variances of the waiting times at the two restaurants are equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the p-value (0.430) is greater than the significance level (5% or 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, at the 5% significance level, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the variances of the waiting times at Restaurant A and Restaurant B are significantly different.\n",
